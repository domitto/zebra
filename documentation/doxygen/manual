\section intro_sec Introduction
Zebra is a digital signal level converter and position capture box. It takes the form of a 1U metal box
with front panel BNCs and LEMOs and rear panel encoder DB15 connectors. Its function is to take
front panel single channel inputs (TTL, LVDS, PECL, NIM, Open Collector) and rear panel encoder
signals (RS422 quadrature with Z channel), pass them through the FPGA to implement logic gates
and position capture circuitry, and output them to front and rear panel outputs of the same format
as inputs.

\section bugs Known Bugs
- When Zebra is outputting position data at maximum rate it can overwhelm the buffers on the serial port. This has been observed on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 with an Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family KT Controller (rev 04). USB serial dongles seem to be unaffected, as do connections via a terminal server. The problem manifests as error messages on the console like:

<code>
zebra:interruptTask: Bad interrupt on encoder 7 in 'P0000440200000000EE6000F00012A1A'
</code>
